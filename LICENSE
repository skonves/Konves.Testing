   PREAMBLE
   
   The GSD (Get Stuff Done) License is a free, open source, copyright free
   license for software and other kinds of works.
   
   This license exists to promote productivity.  Some licenses try to
   provide rights, but deny you the right of removing all rights to
   whatever from whatever, or whatever.  They can be very confusing.
   
   This license is not about rights, but about productivity so that you can
   get stuff done.  If reading the rest of this license does not make you
   more productive, please consider using another license.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   0. Definitions

      “This License” refers to the document You are currently reading.

      “You/Your” refers to the human being reading This License.

      “Productivity” refers to a measure of the efficiency of production.
      Productivity is a ratio of what is produced to what is required to produce
      it. (plagiarized from Wikipedia)

      “Licensed Work” refers to whatever you slap this license on in order
      to invite others to use it to do more work with less effort.

   1. Basic Permissions.
      
      This License explicitly affirms Your unlimited permission to use the
      unmodified Licensed Work in any way deemed fit by You, except when explicitly
      forbidden by law.

   2. Modification and Plagiarism.
   
      The Licensed Work may be modified or plagiarized by You or another party
      at any time as long as either:
   
      a) the modified or unmodified Licensed Work is used in such a way to
         increase the productivity of You or the other party or
         
      b) You or the other party forfeit all rights to Your/their respective
         souls to the original author(s) of the original Licensed Work.

      This License becomes void upon modification of the Licensed Work or the
      blatant plagiarism of the Licensed Work by other party.  At any time,
      the License can be reinstated at Your discretion or at the discretion
      of the plagiarizing party.

   3. Monitary Gain.
   
      You may use the Licensed Work to make money unless explicitly prohibited by law.
      This License does not grant you the right to unlawfully take the money that other
      parties made by using the Licensed Work.

   4. Disclaimer of Warranty.
      
      THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LICENSED WORK, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
      APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
      HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LICENSED WORK “AS IS” WITHOUT
      WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
      LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE
      OF THE LICENSED WORK IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LICENSED WORK PROVE DEFECTIVE,
      YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

   5. Limitation of Liability.
   
      IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
      WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
      THE LICENSED WORK AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
      INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
      ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED WORK (INCLUDING
      BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES
      SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LICENSED WORK TO
      OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER WORKS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

   APPENDIX: How to apply the GSD License to your work.

      To apply the GSD License to your work, we suggest attaching the
      following boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets unless you want to look like an idiot!)  The text
      should be enclosed in the appropriate comment syntax for the file
      format. We also recommend that a file or class name and description of
      purpose be included on the same "printed page" as the copyright notice
      for easier identification within third-party archives.

   Copyright {yyyy} {name of copyright owner or plagerizing party}

   Productively licensed under the GSD License!
